## From frontend developers to Architecture

👨‍💻 @ShinaBR2

# Why this talk

- FE nowadays is not like before with it has itself architecture
- No meaning for old monolith architecture

---

# Main points

---

## Feature based on User Requirements

FE developers are the man who understand how to make features. Some real use cases:

- Do we need a real web server nowadays?
- API calling: REST or GraphQL? Data composition

---

## Error Detection

FE developers should be the first one who find out the root cause of problems reported by end users. Some real use cases:

- Co-operate with designer to have some ways to collect the user feedback. Is that solution doable?
- Logging solution: Users report some generic issue => check Sentry => find the root cause

---

## Integration

Better solutions for integration. FE should understanding how hard problem is on the backend side. Some real use cases:

- Changes on API request/response to adapt some frontend changes.

---

## End
