## From frontend developers to Architecture

👨‍💻 @ShinaBR2

#JusticeForFrontend - Jan 27, 2021<br/>

# Why this talk?

<Steps>

  - "Frontend" nowadays is totally a different ecosystem since:
    + NodeJS (2009) => modularity
    + GraphQL (2015) => new whole ecosystem and architecture like [3factor app](https://3factor.app/)

  - Rising of microservices and mobile devices

  - 👏👏👏 [When frontend means full stack](https://increment.com/frontend/when-frontend-means-full-stack/) by [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/)

</Steps>

# Why Frontend Developers
# need to understand architecture?

---

## 1. Feature based on User Requirements

Development process always comes from UI.

<Steps>

- Web server? No, we don't need for [Jamstack sites](https://jamstack.org/)

- 👉 **Data composition** on client side or server side?

</Steps>

---


## 2. Error Detection

Starting investigate end users BUGs should be from frontend side.

<Steps>

- First, must have a way to get feedback on UI

- Then, error reporting integration

</Steps>

---

## 3. Integration

Integration is not a war. Main real problem:

- Changes on API to adapt UI

---
